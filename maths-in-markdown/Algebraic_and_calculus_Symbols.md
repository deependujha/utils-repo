## 3. Advanced notations 📝

- For **summation**, use `\sum` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\sum_{n=1}^{10}n^2$$` is rendered as $$\sum_{n=1}^{10}n^2$$
<br/>

- For **product**, use `\prod` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\prod_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$` is rendered as $$\prod_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$
<br/>

- For **fraction**, use `\frac` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\frac{1}{2}$$` is rendered as $$\frac{1}{2}$$
<br/>

- For **square root**, use `\sqrt` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\sqrt{2}$$` is rendered as $$\sqrt{2}$$
<br/>

- For **nth root**, use `\sqrt[n]` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\sqrt[n]{27}$$` is rendered as $$\sqrt[n]{27}$$
<br/>

- For **logarithm**, use `\log` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\log_{2} 8$$` is rendered as $$\log_{2} 8$$
<br/>

- For **limit**, use `\lim` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$$` is rendered as $$\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$$
<br/>

- For **better styled limit**, use `$$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$$` is rendered as $$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$$
<br/>

- For **derivative**, use `\frac{dy}{dx}` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\frac{dy}{dx}$$` is rendered as $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$.
<br/>

- For **partial derivative**, use `\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$` is rendered as $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$
<br/>

- For **integration**, use `\int` symbol.
    * e.g. `$$\int_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$` is rendered as $$\int_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$
<br/>
